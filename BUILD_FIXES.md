# Production Deployment Fixes

## Issues Encountered on Server

### 1. Port Conflict (80/443 already in use) ❌
- **Issue**: Traefik reverse proxy was already using ports 80 and 443
- **Symptom**: Docker fails to bind nginx container to these ports
- **Solution**: Use different ports and rely on Traefik for routing

### 2. Missing SSL Certificates ❌
- **Issue**: Nginx configured for HTTPS but certificates didn't exist
- **Symptom**: Nginx fails to start due to missing certificate files
- **Solution**: Either generate certificates first or use HTTP-only mode with Traefik handling SSL

### 3. Seeding Script Failure ❌
- **Issue**: Application startup failing because `scripts/seed.ts` couldn't be found/executed in container
- **Symptom**: Container crashes on startup with "Cannot find module" error
- **Root Causes**:
  - `scripts/` directory not copied to Docker production image
  - `tsx` package not available in production image (only in builder stage)
  - Dependencies needed for seed script not included

## Files That Need Modification

### 1. `Dockerfile` - Missing Seed Script Dependencies
Current Dockerfile doesn't include:
- `scripts/` directory in production image
- `tsx` package for running TypeScript
- `bcryptjs` for password hashing

### 2. `deploy.sh` - Hard-coded Configuration
The script assumes:
- Ports 80/443 are available
- No existing reverse proxy
- SSL certificates can be obtained via Let's Encrypt

Needs options for:
- Using with existing reverse proxy (Traefik)
- Custom port configuration
- Optional seeding

### 4. Turbopack in Production Build ❌
- **Issue**: Build script using `--turbopack` flag causing Prisma errors in production
- **Symptom**: "the URL must start with the protocol `prisma://`" error
- **Root Cause**: Turbopack is experimental and has issues with Prisma Client generation
- **Solution**: Remove `--turbopack` from production build, keep it only for dev

## Solutions Applied

### ✅ Fixed Dockerfile
Added missing dependencies to production image:
```dockerfile
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules/bcryptjs ./node_modules/bcryptjs
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules/tsx ./node_modules/tsx
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules/.bin/tsx ./node_modules/.bin/tsx
COPY --from=builder /app/scripts ./scripts
```

### ✅ Created `deploy-traefik.sh`
New deployment script for servers with Traefik reverse proxy:
- Uses custom internal ports (default: 3010)
- No nginx/certbot containers needed
- Traefik labels for automatic routing
- Connects to external `traefik-public` network

### ✅ Fixed Build Script
Changed from:
```json
"build": "next build --turbopack"
```
To:
```json
"build": "prisma generate && next build"
```

### ✅ Fixed NextAuth UntrustedHost Error
- **Issue**: NextAuth throws `UntrustedHost` error behind reverse proxy
- **Symptom**: `Host must be trusted. URL was: https://ai-edulixa360.hamedelfayome.dev/api/auth/session`
- **Root Cause**: NextAuth doesn't trust the host when behind Traefik/nginx
- **Solution**: Added `AUTH_TRUST_HOST="true"` to environment variables

Both deployment scripts now include:
```bash
AUTH_TRUST_HOST="true"
```

Quick fix script available: `./fix-auth-trust.sh`

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Fresh Server (use `deploy.sh`)
- Installs nginx, certbot, handles SSL
- Uses ports 80/443 directly
- Good for dedicated server

### Option 2: Server with Traefik (use `deploy-traefik.sh`)
- Works with existing Traefik reverse proxy
- Configurable internal port
- Traefik handles SSL and routing
- Good for multi-app servers

### Usage with Traefik:
```bash
# Set custom port if needed (optional)
export APP_PORT=3010
export DOMAIN=ai-edulixa360.hamedelfayome.dev

# Deploy
sudo ./deploy-traefik.sh
```
